# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

* React - I created the SPA (Single Page Application) with it.
* AntD - a component library. I made use of the toggle component.
* axios - I made use of this for the REST API calls.
* react-epic-spinners - I used a spinner from this library to create a good-looking loading page
* styled-components - I made use of this to style the application while scoping styles to components

### Q) What's the command to start the frontend application locally?

`cd frontend && yarn start`

### Q) What libraries did you add to the backend? What are they used for?

* Typescript - I used this to add types in the application, make the code more maintainable by imbibing a statically
  typed approach.
* axios - I made use of this for the REST API calls.
* debug - I used this to debug and log insights to the console
* http-errors - I used this to create HTTP errors for the express application
* morgan - I used this as a request logger (to view information about incoming requests elegantly)

### Q) What's the command to start the backend application locally?
